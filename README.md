# REGEX COMPILER

A very minimal and very incomplete [RegEx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) engine written for education purpose.

## DESCRIPTION

This program is written in C++ and implements a very minimal and very incomplete RegEx engine to demonstrate how it can be done in a few number of lines of code.

The regex engine quite simple and supports only a little subset of the regular expressions grammar.

Metacharacters:

```
^ ... start of text
$ ... end of text
. ... any character
```

Quantifiers:

```
? ... zero or one occurences
* ... zero or more occurences
+ ... one or more occurences
```

Escaped sequences:

```
\a ... bell
\b ... backspace
\t ... horizontal tab
\r ... carriage return
\n ... new line
\v ... vertical tab
\f ... form feed
```

```

You can also use the `-j` option if you want to build in parallel with `GNU make`:

```
make -j{number-of-jobs}
```

### Clean the project

```
make clean
```

### Check the project

To check the project with some tests, simply type:

```
make check
```

## HOW TO RUN

### Usage

Command line options:

```
Usage: pico-regex.bin [OPTIONS...] [PATTERN] [STRING]

Options:

  -h, --help                    display this help and exit
  -v, --verbose                 verbose mode
  -q, --quiet                   quiet mode
  -1, --error                   error log level
  -2, --alert                   alert log level
  -3, --print                   print log level (default)
  -4, --debug                   debug log level
  -5, --trace                   trace log level

```

### Run

You will find the program into the `bin` directory:

```
./bin/pico-regex.bin
```

Example:

```
./bin/pico-regex.bin '^lorem.*amet$' 'lorem ipsum dolor sit amet'
```

Result:

```
ðŸ”µ compiling "^lorem.*amet$"
ðŸŸ¢ the regular expression has been compiled
ðŸ”µ comparing "lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"
ðŸŸ¢ the string matches the regular expression
